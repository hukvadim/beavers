# Beavers. A project for Zachary's exam.

The goal was to score 100 points on the exam. To do this, you need to develop a front-end and a back-end.

## The project has must-have pages:

* Home page.
* Category view.
* Viewing an article.
* Comments in the article view.
* Page with the form for adding an article. 
* Registration / Authorization.
* User profile.
* Edit user profile.
* Develop an admin part where it will be possible to add, edit, delete users, categories, articles and comments.
